SO HERE'S A METHOD ,NOT SURE ABOUT IT'S RYT/WRONG
THERE ARE THREE CHANCES FOR GLOWING THE BULB BY EITHER
1)1ST SWITCH
2)2ND SWITCH
3)3RD SWITCH
AS WE CAN ONLY ENTER INTO THE ROOM ONCE,WE NEED A LITTLEBIT GUESSWORK HERE
SOO TO GUESS THE SWITCH,
ON THE 1ST SWITCH AND WAIT FOR SOME TIME AND THEN OFF IT AND ON THE 2ND SWITCH AND RUN INTO THE ROOM
CASE 1
IF UH SEE BULB DIMMING OUT OR JUST TOUCH THE BULB AND IF ITS WARM:
LOCK ITS THE FIRST SWITCH
CASE 2 
IF THE LIGHT IS GLOWING:
THEN LOCK ITS SECOND SWITCH
CASE 3
IF UH DIDN'T SEE LIGHT DIMMING OFF OR IF THE BULB IS COLD:
THEN LOCK ITS THIRD SWITCH
LOGIC:
THE LOGIC BEHIND TELLING TO ON THE 1ST SWITCH FOR MINUTES IS FOR KNOWING WHERE IT IS WARM OR NOT
IF THE LIGHT IS GLOWING FOR MINUTES THE BULB WILL GET WARM
AND IF THE LIGHT IS NOT TURNED ON THE BULB WILL DEFINETLY WILL BE COOL FROM THAT WE CAN UNDERSTND WHETHER ITS 3RD SWITCH OR NOT
AND IF THE LIGHT IS ON WHEN YOU ENTERED THE ROOM THAT MEANS ITS THE SECOND SWITCH 
WHICH IS ALLOWING THE CURRENT TO PASS.
