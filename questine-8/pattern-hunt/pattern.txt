SO THE SEQUENCE IS :
2, 6, 12, 20, 30, 42
I DIDN'T USE ANY MATHEMATICAL EQUATION TO FIND THISS.. 
WHEN I SAW THIS INSTANTLY I GOT THE LOGIC .. AND ITS SIMPLE
HERE IS IT.
SO THE FIRST ELEMENT IS 2
AND THE SECOND ELEMENT IS 6
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM IS 4.
NOW THE THIRD ELEMENT IS 12
AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 2ND AND 3RD ELEMENT IS 6,WHICH IS 4+2,WHERE 4 IS THE DIFFERNCE WE GOT FROM FIRST 2 ELEMENTS
SO.. THIS THE LOGIC DIFFERNCE BETWEEN THE PREVIOUS TWO NUMBER AND ADD 2 TO GET THE NEXT NUMBER..
I WILL ALSO EXPLAIN THE OTHER ELEMENTS..
NOW THE 4TH ELEMENT IS 20 AND THE DIFFERNCE BETWEEN 20 AND 12 IS 8(6+2)
NOW BY USING THIS LOGIC I GOT THE NEXT ELEMENT AS 30 (DIFFERENCE SHOULD BE 10 THAT IS 8+2)
NEXT ELEMENT IS 42 AS DIFFERENCE SHOULD BE 12(10+2)
THATS IT FOUND THE NEXT TWO DIGITS
