Its little complicated for the farmer but its still possible to keep all three of them safe..
1) farmer will take the goat with and crosses the river and drops the goat across the river and returns back alone to the other side.
2)this time he the wolf with him and crosses the river and returns back with the goat because if both goat and wolf is together wolf may eat the goat
3)now farmer takes the cabbage across the river and returns back alone
4)now atlast he takes goat with him and goes across the river..
Now all three are perfectly safe....
